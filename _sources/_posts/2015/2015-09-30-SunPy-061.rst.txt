Announcing the 0.6.1 "thesis submission" release of SunPy.
This is a bug fix release and contains the following fixes to things
that slipped past us into 0.6:


* Fixed MapCube animations by working around a bug in Astropy's ImageNormalize
* SunPy can now be installed without having to install Astropy first.
* MapCubes processed with ``coalignment.apply_shifts`` now have correct metadata.
* Multiple fixes for WCS transformations, especially with solar-x, solar-y CTYPE headers.

This release is available through either conda or pip, you can update
with either:

::

    conda update sunpy

or

::

    pip update sunpy

depending upon how you have sunpy installed.

Happy Pythoning,

Stuart
