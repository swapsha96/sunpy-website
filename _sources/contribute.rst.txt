        If you are interested in contributing fixes, code or documentation to SunPy please checkout our 
        <a href="#">developer guide</a>. 
        SunPy uses a distributed version control system called 
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and the code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/">GitHub</a>. 
        To get started create an account on 
        <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> 
        and fork SunPy then submit your changes via a pull request. If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub our developer documentation provides a sample 
        <a href="#">workflow</a>
        but you can also find lots of 
        <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/#awesm=~opUWunJA2PgPRq">tutorials</a>
        online. Please read up on our 
        <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/wiki/Developer-Standards">Coding Standards</a>

        <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP/blob/master/SEP-0001.md">more information</a> 
        about SEPs in the appropriate
