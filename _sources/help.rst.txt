Mailing List

      <div class="divider"></div>
      	<p class="content noheader">
      	Sometimes the best way to get your question answered is just by asking someone. SunPy has two mailing lists; a 
      	<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy">general mailing list</a> 
      	for general issues and a 
      	<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sunpy-dev">developer mailing list</a>. 
      	If you have a general question about how SunPy works use the main list. If, on the other hand, you have a question about the inner workings of SunPy or how SunPy is organized or have a question about developing some new feature please use the developer mailing list.
